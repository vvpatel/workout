# Work Break Protocol for Neck/Trap Recovery

## Overview

This document defines the break protocol for preventing and recovering from upper trap/neck tension caused by computer work. Three Timeout app themes are created to support different break types.

---

## Break Schedule (Research-Based)

| Break Type | Theme | Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|------------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Micro Reset** | Micro Reset | Every 25 min | 30-60 sec | Posture reset, quick stretch, 1 breath |
| **Movement Break** | Movement Break | Every 50 min | 5 min | Standing stretches, breathing routine |
| **Extended Reset** | Extended Reset | Every 2 hours | 10-15 min | Full routine, walk away from desk |

### Why This Timing

- Upper trap tension builds within 20-30 min of static posture
- Blood flow to muscles decreases after 30 min of sitting
- Fascia begins to "set" in shortened positions after ~45 min
- 20-20-20 rule for eyes: every 20 min, look 20 feet away for 20 sec
- Studies show microbreaks every 20-30 min reduce musculoskeletal discomfort by 40-60%

## Breathing Exercises Reference

### Physiological Sigh (Fastest Reset)
- **When:** Micro breaks, immediate stress
- **How:** Double inhale through nose → long exhale through mouth
- **Why:** Reinflates alveoli, triggers vagus nerve, drops HR in seconds

### Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)
- **When:** Movement breaks, before meetings
- **How:** 4 sec inhale → 4 sec hold → 4 sec exhale → 4 sec hold
- **Why:** Balances sympathetic/parasympathetic, used by Navy SEALs

### 4-7-8 Breathing
- **When:** Extended breaks, high anxiety
- **How:** 4 sec inhale → 7 sec hold → 8 sec exhale
- **Why:** Extended exhale maximizes parasympathetic activation

### Coherence Breathing
- **When:** Throughout day, HRV optimization
- **How:** 5-6 sec inhale → 5-6 sec exhale, no holds
- **Why:** Optimal for autonomic balance

### Humming Exhale (Vagal Toning)
- **When:** Extended breaks, high stress days
- **How:** Deep inhale → hum "mmm" on exhale until empty
- **Why:** Vibration stimulates vagus nerve in throat, activates parasympathetic

### Eye Refocusing (20-20-20 Rule)
- **When:** Every micro break (every 20-25 min)
- **How:** Look at farthest point visible (20+ feet) for 20 seconds
- **Why:** Prevents accommodative fatigue, reduces digital eye strain

## Screen Position Fix (⚠️ ROOT CAUSE)

**Problem identified:** You tend to focus on the lower-left of your monitor, causing:
- Head tilted down and left
- Right upper trap/levator scap overworking to hold head position
- Chronic tension → knot formation on RIGHT side

### One-Time Setup Fixes
| Fix | Why | How |
|-----|-----|-----|
| **Raise monitor** | Top of screen at eye level | Monitor arm, laptop stand, or books |
| **Center primary window** | Most-used app in center of screen | Drag IDE/terminal to center |
| **Use window manager** | Prevent drift to corners | Rectangle app, or manual habit |
| **Check chair height** | Feet flat, thighs parallel to floor | Adjust seat height |
| **Keyboard position** | Elbows at 90°, wrists neutral | May need keyboard tray |

### During-Work Fixes
1. **Center your primary work** in the middle of screen, at eye level
2. **Move frequently-used windows** (terminal, code, chat) to center
3. **Avoid looking down-left** - that's your danger zone
4. **Every break:** Check "Am I looking center?"

### Quick Posture Reset (Add to EVERY break)
1. ✓ Eyes to center of screen
2. ✓ Chin tucked (not jutting forward)
3. ✓ Ears over shoulders
4. ✓ Shoulders down and back

### Why This Matters
Looking 15° off-center for 8 hours = your right upper trap doing an 8-hour isometric hold.
That's the equivalent of holding a light dumbbell with your trap all day.
No wonder it forms a knot!

## Key Form Cues (⚠️ For Your Trap Issue)

### DO:
- ✅ Depress shoulders DOWN before any stretch
- ✅ Keep chin tucked during neck stretches
- ✅ Breathe into stretches, don't force
- ✅ Stop if pain increases
- ✅ Focus on LOWER trap activation, not upper

### DON'T:
- ❌ Shrug shoulders up during any movement
- ❌ Force neck stretches beyond mild tension
- ❌ Hold breath during stretches
- ❌ Do exercises that cause pain in the trap knot
- ❌ Skip the breathing - it's not optional for recovery
